Bronco Ember is a NASA TechLeap Autonomous Oberservation Challenge Winner

Bronco Ember is a nascent wildfire detection system that uses a combination of artificial intelligence, edge computing, infrared imaging, and a 2 degree of gimbal. The system is designed to be small and compact while still being able to provide large impact to the wild fire prevention and detection industry. 

The system has already undergone its first test flight that provided successful results and a proving ground to continue development on the emerging technology. The system is udergoing continued development to refine and improve the system that is capable of indentify a fire that is less than 20 feet in diameter in 5 minutes or less after first ignition.
